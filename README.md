The six rules of finance: 

* Money has a time value.
* Higher returns are expected for taking on more risk.
* Diversification of investments can reduce risk.
* Financial markets are efficient in pricing securities.
* Manager and stockholder objectives may differ.
* Reputation matters.

# Portfolio Management

**Modern Portfolio Theory** - asset class diversification (don't put all your eggs in one basket) 

Optimal Portfolio to minimize risk and maximize returns = **risk adjusted return** 
* **systematic risk** - market risk of investments (example - the risk of investing in the stock market) 
* **unsystematic risk** - risks associated with that specific investment 

Minimize systematic risk by splitting portfolio amongst asset classes.

# The Intelligent Investor

> “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”

* " Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account, nor in any part of your thinking."
* " stocks do well or poorly in the future because the businesses behind them do well or poorly—nothing more, and nothing less"
* “Be sure it’s yours before you go into it."
* "The rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and skill."
